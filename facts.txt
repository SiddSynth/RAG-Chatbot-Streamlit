The History of Formula 1 (F1)

Origins and First Race:
Formula 1 began in 1950. The first World Championship race was held at Silverstone in the United Kingdom on May 13, 1950. Giuseppe Farina, driving for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers' Championship.

The Fangio Era (1950s):
Juan Manuel Fangio was the first dominant figure in F1, winning five World Championships (1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957) with four different manufacturers (Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Mercedes, and Ferrari). This record stood for 46 years.

Technological Evolution (1960s-1970s):
In 1958, the Cooper team introduced rear-engined cars, revolutionizing the sport. By the 1960s, all cars adopted this layout. In the late 1960s, wings and aerodynamics were introduced to increase grip.

The Senna vs. Prost Era (1980s):
The late 1980s and early 1990s were defined by the intense rivalry between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. They dominated the sport driving for McLaren-Honda. Senna won three championships (1988, 1990, 1991) before his tragic death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

The Schumacher Dominance (2000s):
Michael Schumacher became the face of F1 in the early 2000s. Driving for Ferrari, he won five consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004. He retired with a record 7 World Championships, a number later matched by Lewis Hamilton.

The Hamilton and Hybrid Era (2014-2020):
In 2014, F1 switched to V6 Turbo Hybrid engines. Mercedes-AMG Petronas dominated this era. Lewis Hamilton won 6 of his 7 titles during this period, becoming the driver with the most race wins and pole positions in history.

The Verstappen Era (2021-Present):
Max Verstappen won his first title in 2021 after a controversial and intense final lap battle with Lewis Hamilton in Abu Dhabi. Red Bull Racing dominated the following years with the introduction of "ground effect" aerodynamics in 2022.

Key Records:
- Most Championships (Driver): Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton (7 each).
